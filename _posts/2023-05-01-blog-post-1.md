Algarve is the southernmost region of Portugal and it is known for the beautiful cliffs carved by the sea and the wind, and the large sandy beaches that attract unique birds.

I was surprised by the number of golf courses and hotels in the landscapes and found public data on them. There were 86 golf courses in 2017 and 91 approved projects for future ones.

The oldest golf course in the database opened in 1890 in Espinho and we can see an explosion of new courses since 1990.

It is also interesting to observe that the courses are mostly concentrated in specific regions, namely Algarve, Lisbon and Porto. This is a study on different ways to show their density.
