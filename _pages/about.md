Hello,

My name is Mariana and I have been in the software industry for over five years.

After my Master's in Applied Physics, I have worked with mission control systems of satellite ground segments, optical spectrometers and road climatology.

In this path, I have perfected my exploration skills as a tester, simplicity as a developer and pedagogical side as a data scientist.

There has always been new domain knowledge and different tools in each project. And they will keep appearing. I believe that with curiosity and patience anything can be learned.

In this little speck of the web I intend to share my investigations inspired by everyday topics. Check them [here](https://madammad.github.io/publications).

Let's connect and find ways to work together!
