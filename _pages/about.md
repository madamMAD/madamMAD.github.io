Hello,

My name is Mariana and after my master's in Applied Physics, I have been working in the software industry for over five years, in Sweden and Germany.

In the domains of road climatology, optical spectrometry and the ground segment in satellite communication, I have improved my exploration skills as a tester, simplicity as a developer and pedagogical side as a data scientist.

In this little speck of the web I intend to share some of my investigations inspired by every day topics. Check them [here](https://madammad.github.io/year-archive).

Let's connect and find ways to work together!
